m-swipe-slider
==============

Minimalist, responsive, touch enabled slider developed with performance in mind (size/responsiveness/battery).

This is a alpha release (tested in Chrome, FF, IE8+, Opera, Android Chrome and iOS) - there is still room for improvement.


How to run this via Grunt
-------------------------
To work on the slider leveraging a static file server and automatic reload or to uglify the file.

- Install grunt
 ```bash
 npm install -g grunt-cli
 ```
- cd into directory and 
 ```bash
 grunt
 ```
